The are two diffetent versions of code. In the first one you can observe agent playing and winning(have not seen him losing yet) against opponent who chooses his moves randomly. The second one is more complex because it has got its own memory which is being sent to the file `game_memory.json` where it stores all the moves and outcomes of it. This version is also fun because of availability to play with agent by yourself so you can try it out
